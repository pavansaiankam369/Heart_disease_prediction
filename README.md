### README for Heart Disease Prediction Model

#### Description

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health parameters using a Logistic Regression model. It involves data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and building a predictive system.

#### Libraries Used

- `numpy`: For numerical operations and array manipulations.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `sklearn`: For machine learning algorithms and utilities.

#### Data Collection and Processing

The dataset (`heart_disease_data.csv`) is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame (`heart_data`). Various aspects of the dataset are explored:

- **Data Loading**: The CSV data is loaded into a DataFrame and its first and last five rows are printed.
- **Data Information**: The structure and summary statistics of the dataset are displayed.
- **Missing Values Check**: No missing values are found.
- **Statistical Measures**: Descriptive statistics of numeric columns are shown.
- **Target Variable Distribution**: The distribution of the target variable (`target`) is examined.

#### Splitting Features and Target

- Features (`x`) and the target (`y`) are separated from the dataset.
- The data is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.

#### Model Training

- **Logistic Regression**: A Logistic Regression model is trained on the training data.

#### Model Evaluation

- **Accuracy Score**: The accuracy of the model is evaluated on both training and testing datasets.

#### Building a Predictive System

- A function is created to predict whether a person has heart disease based on input parameters.
- An example prediction is made and displayed.

#### Files Included

- **heart_disease_data.csv**: The dataset used for training and testing.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project and its usage.

#### Installation and Usage

1. **Installation**:
   - Clone the repository.
   - Ensure Python 3.x and required libraries are installed (`numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`).

2. **Usage**:
   - Run `python script.py` to execute the predictive system and see sample outputs.
   - Customize `input_data` with relevant parameters for predictions.
